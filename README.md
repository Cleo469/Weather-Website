Weather Website 🌤️

Welcome to the Weather Website! This simple website allows users to input their current city and temperature, and it dynamically updates the display to reflect this information. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it’s deployed using GitHub Pages.

Project Overview:

The Weather Website provides an interactive and customizable experience where users can view the current temperature and weather in a sample city (Tokyo, by default).
Update the city and temperature by clicking the Change City button.
See a different emoji (😄 or ☹️) based on the temperature they enter. 
The website is designed to be clean and minimalist, with an emphasis on ease of use and aesthetic appeal.
